## Overview

Neural Authentication Control Framework (NACF) is an enterprise-grade authentication solution that leverages electroencephalography (EEG) signals for secure, continuous user authentication. Built with production readiness in mind, NACF combines advanced signal processing with state-of-the-art machine learning to deliver a robust authentication framework.

## Key Features

### Authentication Capabilities
- Biometric authentication using unique EEG patterns
- Continuous user verification without interruption
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Adaptive security based on risk assessment

### Technical Features
- Real-time signal processing and filtering
- Advanced artifact removal and quality assessment
- Support for multiple deep learning architectures
- Distributed session management
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Redis 6.0 or higher
- ONNX Runtime 1.8.0 or higher
- CUDA 11.1+ (for GPU acceleration, optional)

### Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install nacf

# For development installation
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Quick Start

```python
from nacf import NeuroAuthClient
import numpy as np

# Initialize client
client = NeuroAuthClient(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    endpoint="https://api.nacf.example.com/v1"
)

# Example EEG data (8 channels, 1000 samples)
eeg_data = np.random.randn(8, 1000).astype(np.float32)

# Enroll user
enroll_result = client.enroll_user(
    user_id="user_123",
    eeg_data=eeg_data,
    metadata={"device_id": "eeg_headset_xyz"}
)

# Authenticate user
auth_result = client.authenticate(
    user_id="user_123",
    eeg_data=eeg_data
)

print(f"Authentication successful: {auth_result.authenticated}")
print(f"Confidence: {auth_result.confidence:.2%}")
```
